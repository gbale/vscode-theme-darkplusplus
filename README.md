# Dark++ Theme for VS Code
A dark theme for Visual Studio Code, inspired by default themes in Visual Studio & Notepad++.

The theme is based on Dark+ (default dark), with adjusted colors for block comments, line comments, language constants, operator keywords, expression keywords, and hint diagnostic ellipses.  

The default state (folder opened, non-debug) status bar color is also changed to dark gray.
