# Dark++ for Visual Studio Code

This extension adds **Dark++** and **Dark++ Modern** themes, based on the Visual Studio Code defaults with slightly adjusted syntax highlighting inspired by Visual Studio & Notepad++.

Colors are adjusted for block comments, line comments, language constants, operator keywords, expression keywords, and hint diagnostic ellipses. In Dark++, the default state (folder opened, non-debug) status bar color is changed to dark gray.
