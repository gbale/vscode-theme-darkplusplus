# Dark++ for Visual Studio Code

This VS Code extension adds **Dark++ Modern** and **Dark++** color themes, based on the default themes with slightly adjusted syntax highlighting inspired by Visual Studio and Notepad++.

## Details
Both **Dark++ Modern** and **Dark++** extend the default VS Code themes with several new colors:

- [TextMate scopes](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/syntax-highlight-guide#textmate-tokens-and-scopes) are defined for:
  - Block comments, line comments, language constants, operator keywords, expression keywords, and hint diagnostic ellipses.

- [Semantic scopes](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/semantic-highlight-guide) are defined for:
  - C# XML documentation comments.

In **Dark++** only, the status bar color in the default state (folder open, non-debug) is changed to dark gray.
